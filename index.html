				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p id="P1">In this project, I was planning to do a weather app for hikers. As we all know, people need to consider lots of factors before hiking, such as food, clothing, medicine, weather and so on. And weather would be the most important factor of the schedule because it will directly influence the hikers’ plan when it will be getting worse. Therefore, my purse of this project is to make an app about weather for convenience.  And I was trying to demonstrate the weather changes for the hikers so that they can know it as soon as possible. For this part, I was mainly focusing on three parts of the weather, including humidity, temperature and wind. Hikers can choose select clothing by themselves for three factors. </p>
				<h1>Target</h1>
				<p id="P1">This app is mainly for hikers, and it can be used for daily life. </p>
			</div>

			<h1>Purpose</h1>
			<p id="P2">
				The purpose of this project is to find a way to describe the weather directly so that the users can get it easily. The traditional weather app is about showing all the data via numbers. Even though it can show all the information clearly, the disadventages of it is users can’t understand the changes correctly via number. So in this project, I was focusing on using data visualization to describe the weather changes.

		<h3>Inspiration</h3>
		<p id="P4">I searched some designers online for inspirations, such as <b> Outcrowd</b>, <b>KREATIVA Studio</b>, <b>Ahsan Raz</b>, and <b>Elegant Seagulls</b>. In my opinion, Outcrowd’s and Raz’s design are very cool. They all have a preference on geometry. Also, they are good at using vivid color to make the design virsually nice. So I am influenced by their design in this project.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="research_content">
		<h3>Colors</h3>
		<p id="P4">Geometry and vivid color are nice partners. They work well when designers put them together. Vivid color is a good way to catch users’ attention. However, it really takes time on adjusting the color matching. And I found that some designers will utilize <b> saturation </b>and<b> transparency</b> when they do the geometry design.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="research_content">
		<h3>Patterns</h3>
		<p id="P4">Now, more and more designers like utilizing <b>geometry</b> to do the modern design, especially the app and website. They found that geometry can create different shapes via using simple elements. Also, it can help them to minimalize the design and make it clear.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="research_content">
		<h3>Changes</h3>
		<p id="P4">When I did the searching online, I found that data visualization is a popular method to describe the data changes, especially for the Internet. Because the users doesn’t have to translate the data in their mind when they see the changes.  </p>

		<h3>Humidity </h3>
		<p id="P3">Humidity can explain the rainfall for the users quickly. I divided it into five level and try to show these to the users rather than telling them a specific number. It would be more convenient for them to understand what they should prepare for the rainfall.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="Mockup_content">
		<img class="apps-img" src="img/iphone-6s-plus-1534380-03.png">
		<h3>Temperature</h3>
		<p id="P3">Temperature is an important factor for hiking. Users can associate the temperature with natural environment quickly. It tells it is hot or cold outside. I used the line and dots to emphasize the changes so the users can get it easily.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="Mockup_content">
		<img class="apps-img" src="img/iphone-6s-plus-1534380-04.png">
		<h3>Wind Speed</h3>
		<p id="P3">We should pay attention on wind speed in some cities, like Wellington. If it’s windy outside, tie your hair before going out. If it’s windy and rainy outside in Wellington, please don’t forget your wind breakers. So wind speed can really tell something important in some cities.</p>

		<h3>Logo Design</h3>
		<p id="P5">For the logo design, I wanna make it constant with my app design. Therefore, I keep utilizing geometry and transparency to do my logo. Also, in order to tell users that this is a weather app, I combined the weather elements into my logo. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="Introduction_content">
		<h3>Characters</h3>
		<p id="P5">Since my initial idea is from 24 solar terms and Tung Shing. They are all from China.Firstly, I thought of my design via using Chinese character. But not everyone can read Chinese or understand Chinese. Then I started to think of my design again via using English character. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="Introduction_content">
		<h3>Patterns Design</h3>
		<p id="P5">Line, circle and rectangle are very commonly used in my project one. It is easier to express the weather via using those elements to draw the symbol of weather. Additionally, it can minimalize the design for making it nicer and more visible.  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="Introduction_content">
		<h3>Color Selections</h3>
		<p id="P5">For the colors selection, I thought of using some vivid colors to catch users’ attention. But it is not what I want in this project. My goal is to let hikers get the information quickly and easily, vivid colors wouldn’t help a lot. So I chose soft color to my design more acceptable. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="Introduction_content">
		<h3>Weather Changes</h3>
		<p id="P5">I chose using patterns to describe the data (humidity, temperature and wind speed) because I believe it would help hikers/users to understand the changes of the weather. For the wind speed, I drew the trees to show the level of wind instead of telling a specific number. </p>
	</div>

<section id="Summary" class="Summary">
	<div class="main">
		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<p id="P1">There are two main challenges for me in this project. One of them is how to make an app like a real app. I need to think about tendency of colors, patterns for my users. Also, keep making the design constant through the process. Another challenge is how to show everything without a tradition way. It is an easy way to give some numbers to the users, but how can we know the users can understand the meaning of the numbers. And that is what I really pursue in this project. </p>
